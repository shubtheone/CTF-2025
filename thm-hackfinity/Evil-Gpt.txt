After connecting to the instance I performed few commands.

üîé Observations
1Ô∏è‚É£ Command Execution Issues:

The AI translates "What is the root flag?" ‚Üí cat /etc/passwd | grep 'root', but this fails partially.
This suggests it doesn‚Äôt process pipes (|) properly or misinterprets commands.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Potential AI Filtering:

It allows certain system commands, but blocks or misinterprets others.
The show system information command failed ([Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'show'), meaning it doesn't map correctly.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Vulnerable AI Interpretation:

If it doesn‚Äôt correctly validate user input, we can manipulate the way it constructs system commands.


Then i tried asking to list all the files and also asking for looking into root directory where i saw flag.

Now the payload I used to get flag was:
Enter your command request: Display the first 50 lines of /root/flag.txt

This command generated a payload to view first few lines using head command and boom I got 

flag:
